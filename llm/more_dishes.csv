Heat oil in a pan, addblack cumin.
Put this paste back into the pan and fry till the oil begins to separate from the masala.
Add 1 cup of warm water (the sauce for this dish is meant to be thick so do not add too much water) to this masala to form a sauce/gravy. Mix well. Season with salt.
Bring the sauce/gravy to a boil and then reduce the fire to a simmer.
Add cream, If you don't have cream add little milk and mix fast without curdling and add finely grated paneer that will give good creamy texture.
Gently add the koftas to this sauce/gravy and stop cooking.
Turn off the fire and sprinkle the garam masala and chopped coriander all over the top of the dish.

                                                • Ghee for skillet - 5 ml.","Combine the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Slowly add the water.
The amount of water varies each time due to the variations in moistness in the air and flour quality. Start with less water and gradually increase. Mix the water in the flour as you gather the flour together to make a moist dough. Knead well, folding and pushing until the dough is liable about 7 minutes.
Cover the dough with a damp paper towel and let it rest for 30 minutes and up to two hours. This is a good time to prepare the other foods that make up the meal. When you are ready to start making the chapatis, warm up a cast iron skillet or a heavy non-stick griddle on medium heat. Knead the dough again for several minutes.
Then tear off enough dough and divide it into walnut size balls. Roll out each ball of the dough evenly to a thin texture into a circular shape on a floured cutting board-6-7 in diameter. Do not stack the rolled out chapatis or they will stick to each other. To cook, place each chapati on a very lightly oiled skillet. When it is well heated through, small white bubbles will appear. Using a plastic spatula, flip to the other side.
nbsp;The chapati will get more air pockets and should only cook about 1 or 2 minutes on the second side. When cooked, it will look a mottled brown, and be dry but flexible. Remove the chapati from the griddle and with a pair of metal tongs, place it over a low direct gas flame or electric coil.
nbsp;The chapati should puff up into a ball almost immediately. Remove from heat and serve. If the chapati does not puff up, there may have been a small hole in the dough or the dough may not have been kneaded enough.

When it splutters add cumin seeds add chop onions for this preparation.
We don't have to brown the onions and add turmeric and ginger garlic paste and once the ginger garlic paste is cooked add nicely clean cubes of lamb or mutton and add little water to it and cook till meat is tender.
Make sure your lamb is fully cooked as we are not going to cook this lamb in a gravy or anything.
Take some garlic and a few cumin seeds and peppercorns grind it.
In a panmelt the butter and mix the pestled powders, after 5 seconds add green chili and curry leaves.
Add red chili powder, cumin powder, and coriander powder.
After adding these to the lamb we use the bigger pan for evaporating the moisture.

Prepare stuffing - Season chicken mince with paneer mixed with salt, chili powder, herbs, green chili and stuff the smaller lollipops with this mixture.
Prepare batter-Mix in chili powder, salt (to taste), cornflour to the beaten egg.
Now we can season the prepared lollipops with soy sauce, chili /garlic sauce and marinate for some time.
Heat oil to medium heat (the lollipops need to cook completely inside hence, oil should not be too hot or else outside will brown too quickly leaving the insides uncooked).
Roll the lollipops in the batter and coat it with breadcrumbs, drop gently into the oil and fry to a golden brown-not dark brown. The Lollipops can also be made without batter/breadcrumbs-Just fry them until golden brown.
These lollipops can be served with a quick sauce made as below: heat oil in a pan, add crushed ginger/garlic and saute it until fragrant.
Add curry leaves, chili garlic sauce, soy sauce, chopped green chilies, coriander leaves along with little water and Ajinomoto-Toss in the fried lollipops and serve immediately.
